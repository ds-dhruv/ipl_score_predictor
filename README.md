# ipl_score_predictor

I collected historical IPL match data from sources like Kaggle or IPL websites through web scraping. Then, I used machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Regression for training. I evaluated the prediction system's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure accuracy. This resulted in a robust IPL score prediction system that provides accurate predictions using real-time data, benefiting cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and betting professionals.
